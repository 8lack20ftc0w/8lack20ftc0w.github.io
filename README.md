# How to Use

Simply fork this repository and start editing the `_config.yml` file!

For those unfamiliar with how Jekyll works, check out [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/) for all the details, or read up on just the basics of [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), [writing posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/), and [creating pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).

# Added Features

I've integrated lots of nice Jekyll features into the theme, such as:
* [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) contact form integration - just add your email to the `_config.yml` and it works!
* Social profiles are linked from usernames you enter in `_config.yml`.
* **Coming soon**: Featured images and thumbnails in front matter for the homepage posts grid.
* **Coming soon**: Easy featured image settings in `_config.yml` - choose to have Jekyll use a set height for featured images or have it display the entire image, pushing the page content further down.

This is Phantom, a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive
image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). Makes use of some
SVG and animation techniques I've been experimenting with on that other project of mine
you may have heard about (https://carrd.co), and includes a handy generic page for whatever.

you can use for pretty much whatever.
